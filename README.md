# GiphyPage
This is a pproject that is made using Giphy AP ajax, and a small amount of bootstrap. It gives you random gifs of an animal based on the button clicked at the top. You can also add an animal to the list and get images of said animal. Each time you click a button, a list of 10 gifs will popup and be displayed along with its rating(PG, PG-13, G, R, NC-17).


# Psuedocode
Page is still missing the ability to pause and play gif images.
